* Setting up Raspberry Pi

** Install Ubuntu Server 22/4 LTS
** Connect it to network

I plugged my raspberry pi into the switch

In order to find the address and connect to it through ssh, we can use nmap tool. In my case it was:

#+begin_src bash
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24 | grep -i raspberry -B3
#+end_src

** SSH into the machine

#+begin_src bash
ssh ubuntu@your_ip
#+end_src

** Change host name

#+begin_src bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname worker14
#+end_src

** Set static IP address
For each of the devices edit `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` to have following content (set different IP addresses):

#+begin_src text
   network:
     ethernets:
       eth0:
       dhcp4: false
       addresses:
         - 192.168.0.50/24
       routes:
         - to: 0.0.0.0/0
         via: 192.168.0.1
   version: 2
#+end_src

Reduce file permissions on that file:

#+begin_src bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
#+end_src

Finally, let's apply new configuration:

#+begin_src bash
sudo netplan apply
#+end_src
